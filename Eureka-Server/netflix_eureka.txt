Netflex Eureka:
=======================
What is Eureka?
* In simple word Eureka is a service Registry or we can say it is an embedded server provided 
  by Netflix third party which integrate with spring framework.
* Main purpose to use Eureka is Micro service Registration and Discovery with Spring Cloud
  and Netflix's Eureka

What is the use of Eureka?
========================
* Normally in Micro Service Architecture Design we are developing separate Services and exposing
 each API as service Endpoint and whenever we required to access other services in simple we are
 accessing it  as a Rest client using third party API either Rest Template or Client Builder


* As per this diagram we can see there we have 3 micro services and each are interlink with
  each other to perform business operation

* Here rest client accessing 3 services using Rest Template and passing the URL as per image
* Think is my service have only one end point?
* No there may be chance my service can have n number of Endpoint So who will remember all the
  end point URL to access their features? To overcome this issue Netflix team came up with Eureka
  concept, let’s see now how they reduces developers burden.
* As I already mention Eureka is Service Registry, with a great features i.e. just register your
  all micro services with Eureka server then no need to call each service by passing exact URL
  like host name, port just give your service name with which you registered with Eureka server
  and at end just add endpoint URL


* Normally we are using below URL to access Payment endpoint

	http://localhost:8083/service3/payment    

* Instead of passing this URL from client just pass like below you no need to bother about 
  what’s the port and host name Eureka will take care of this he will auto route it. If that
  service is registered with Eureka
	
	http://serviceName/service3/payment

 
* Assume our service is Payment-Service So Eureka will expect the URL to pass to consume rest
  from client like below
	
	http://PaymentService/service3/payment

 
** How Eureka will identify which port this payment service deployed and what is the host info?
=> As we are registering microservice in Eureka server so Eureka internally keeping one instance
   of our service, so based on service name it will go to that particular Service and search the
   last append end point URL Then it will delegate Request to that service

* So see the above diagram as I registered my all services in Eureka,So I can now access them 
  like below

=> Product Service: http://PRODUCT-SERVICE/product

=> Order Service: http://ORDER-SERVICE/product

=> Payment Service: http://PAYMENT-SERVICE/product
